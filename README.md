# Link Text and Location Copier
Firefox web extension that lets you copy link text and location or the page title and location from the context menu.

[Install **Link Text and Location Copier** from addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/link-text-and-location-copier/)

Heavily inspired by the [CoLT](https://github.com/jgbishop/colt) add-on, using code from Firefox's [context-menu-copy-link-with-types](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/context-menu-copy-link-with-types)  web extension example.

## Possible TODOs
* ~~Add fancy icon~~
* ~~Add more 'copy as' formats (Markdown, BBCode, what-have-you)~~
* ~~Internationalization~~
* Make configurable/Customalization
* Come up with better name ~~and/or icon~~
* Make extension work in Chrome/Opera/Edge
